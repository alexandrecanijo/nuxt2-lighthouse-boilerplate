  <h1>Nuxt2 with 100 Lighthouse score</h1>
</div>

## What

A starting point and reusable Nuxt2 application, based on the one generated by Nuxt-CLI with all settings already setup up, with performance in mind, to achieve a 100% Lighthouse score.

## Why

Generating a fresh setup of a Nuxt2 application is always a tedious process and by default, it won't achieve a good Lighthouse score.
This project aims to speed up the process of starting up an application and trying to get a perfect Lighthouse score, with all the main features a medium/large application should have.

## How

By setting up some Nuxt configs, removing all the clutter and still having a viable boilerplate.
The goal is to have with every update a perfect 100 Lighthouse score.

## Inspiration

Several articles and repositories inspired me to create this one, but the main goal was to have a starting point, for all my Nuxt apps.
